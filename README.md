## Usage

First thing to do is to obtain a `config.json` that will hold all the necessary
information to consume the Google Drive API. To do that follow the steps from
this link:

https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/python

After that you should move the `config.json` to `~/.config/gdrive/config.json`
